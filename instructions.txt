Find errors in the Van Gogh Site!

Your task is to find all of the errors in the HTML code.  There are 10 errors.

You do not need to change any of the existing CSS.  If the CSS is written one
way, and the HTML is written another, then the HTML is wrong!

HINTS:
 - Use van-gogh.png as reference for what the site should look like.
 - Check ALL opening and closing tags.
 - Make sure all of the tags are valid and used correctly.
